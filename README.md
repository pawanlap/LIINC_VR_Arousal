## Data folder contains:
  - 25 human subject data (ND1 - ND25)
  - Each subject folder contains 8 files, one per experimental run
  - Each file is labeled with the subject number, condition ('low' = easy condition; 'high' = hard condition) and run number eg. ND1_Low_1.mat
  - Each file contains EEG, ECG, eyetracking, head movement and paradigm data (further details can be found in scripts located in the Analysis_Scripts folder)
  - Detailed experimental design and data collection procedure can be found in the published journal artcile linked above
  - All data were collected in accordance to the Columbia University Institutional Review Board procedure
  - All data are in .mat format and can be loaded directly into MATLAB

## Preliminary analysis scripts can be found under Analysis_Scripts folder. Further analysis scripts can be requested by contacting pl2622@columbia.edu.
